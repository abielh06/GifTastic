Week 6 homework assignment:
Giphy API

I created an a fun app full of gifs using the giphy api!!!
Here is the documentation for the Giphy API: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI

I made an array of actions and made buttons out of them.
When you click on a button, 10 images are retrieved from giphy api and displayed on the page.
When you click on the image, the gif plays. When you click again, the gif stops playing.

The rating of each gif will also appear on the page.

Check out my app at: https://abielh06.github.io/GifTastic/
